### Introduction

Some NodeJS server examples for research - no frameworks or libraries allowed, until features are added.

All throughout - keep track of usage and add questions, potential problems

### Node.JS Server Examples

1. Basic Server
2. Create a http server with endpoints for GET, POST 
    - Other methods would be the same logic
3. Add tests to cover functionality (tests must be kept maintained throughout project) <-- Currently in progress
4. Implement a domain block/CORs
5. Convert to Typescript
    - Make sure all things are typed
6. Add a Logger
7. Add HTTPS
8. Setup up WebSocket 
9. Add Websocket Secure
10. HTTP/2
11. Setup a proxy
12. Create a basic skeleton
    - Routing middleware
    - Options to toggle CORs and Logging


### Features
1. Add a MongoDB instance
2. Add a GraphQL instance
3. Deploy to K8S docker swarm stack
    - End result must be re-usable
    

### Review
1. Benchmark code and see if it can be improved on
2. Review remaining comments


### DONE!!
